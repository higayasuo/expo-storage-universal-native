 * NativeSecureStorage implements the Storage interface using Expo's SecureStore.

 * - Uses expo-secure-store for platform-specific secure storage implementation
 * - Provides encryption at rest for stored data
 * - Suitable for storing sensitive information like authentication tokens, API keys, and user credentials
 * - Data persists across app restarts
